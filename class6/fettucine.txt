Fill a large pot two thirds full with water. Add one tablespoon each of salt and vegetable oil. Bring to a rollling boil.
Reduce heat, add pasta, and stir briefly. Cook until pasta is al dente.
Just before the pasta is ready (about five minutes), melt the butter in a frying pan on low heat.
After the butter has melted, add the heavy cream to the pan. Increase the heat to medium and stir until the mixture is slightly thickened. Remove the pan from the heat once the mixture is ready.
Drain the fettuccini when it's done and add it to the mixture in the frying pan.
Mix three ounces of the cheese the the fettuccini and toss the entire mixture.
Add another three ounces of cheese and the white pepper, and toss again lightly.
